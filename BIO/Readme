Project Topic: Feature Extraction in Fingerprint Images and Marking Diseased Regions

This program requests installed Python 3.6 and these libraries:
- numpy (NumPy library)
- cv2 (OpenCV library)
- matplotlib (Matplotlib library)
- skimage (scikit-image library)
- pywt (PyWavelets library)

Libraries can be installed via pip3 and these commands:
sudo apt install python3-pip
pip3 install opencv-python
pip3 install scikit-image
pip3 install PyWavelets

Other libraries like NumPy or Matplotlib should be installed along with these 3 libraries automatically.

The program is run with command:
python3.6 bioProject.py <arguments>, where arguments can be following:

markfile <img_path> - Mark diseased regions in fingerprint image, showed image can be closed by pressing "q" key on keyboard
markfolder <folder_id> - Mark diseased regions for folder of images, where <folder_id> could be 1 or 2 (1 - Eczema, 2 - Verrucas)
orb <img_path> - Find and show ORB features of fingerprint
lbp <img_path> - Show LBP image and histogram
wavelet <img_path> - Show details of image processed with Wavelet transform
sobel <img_path> - Show image processed by Sobel and Laplacian operator

IMPORTANT NOTE:
Because WIS has limited size for uploaded archive, it is necessary to download datasets via script before running the project:
chmod +x downloadDatasets.sh
./downloadDatasets.sh

Two datasets with eczema or verrucas will be downloaded to ./dataset folder.
Two folders with example of processed images with marked diseased regions will be downloaded to ./markedImg folder.
Processed results of markfolder command can be found in ./markedImg/myMarkedImg
Marking fingerprints (especially with eczema) usually takes some minutes.
sobel and wavelet commands also show features from GLCM matrix in console.
